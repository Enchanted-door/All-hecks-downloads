Roblox heck download link: `https://wrdcdn.net/r/54921/1761378216369/krnl_release_2.695.956_2025.10.20_52.apk` 
or if it doesn't work : `https://deltaexecutor.filesadda.com/Delta-v2.696.apk`
The roblox heck updates constantly so if it says use a new update when u are trying to open them, go to : `https://wearedevs.net/d/Krnl` 
or `https://delta-executor.com/download/` and scroll down and press on the first button to download.

After following the steps and downloading a file that look like something like : `krnl_release_2.693.960_2025.10.6_51.apk`   
Go to your downloads (press on the 3 dots on the right top, then click on "downloads") and it will show a file that looks like the one I told u before,
Just simply click on the file, and it will show "download this app?" or something like that, click on yes and it will download, after finishing, exit chrome(or whatever browser)
and the app will look just like it was before, but when u open it, and join a game, there will be a sigma button at the middle top of ur screen, click on it.
it will open a menu, you can use ur own script or click the section where there is a üîç thing, then search up ur game or anything u want to do, then press on the play button.
but it might not work first try, so u might need to save it and press on the play button multiple times to  get ur heck working.
